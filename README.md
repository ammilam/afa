# AFA Tech and Digital Proposal(s)

This document is intended to act as both a proposal, and a groups of requirements, to be presented to the AFA with the goal of future proofing the non-profit and boosting membership. From an value add standpoint, this is broken down into the following focus areas:

* [Boost membership](#boost-membership)
* [Google for Non-Profits](#google-for-non-profits)
* [Advertising and Marketing](#advertising-and-marketing)
* [Social Media Presence](#social-media-presence)
* [Add new tech/digital/social revenue streams](#add-new-tech-digital-social-revenue-streams)
* [Add more visibility to AFA products](#add-more-visibility-to-afa-products)
* [AFA Digital Content Accessibility](#afa-digital-content-accessibility)
* [Improve workflow and digital work tracking](#improve-workflow-and-digital-work-tracking)

## Rules To Live By

- Members **must** come first. Any and all endeavors we embark upon must have members placed at the top of the priorty list
- Whenever possible/appropriate, get AFA products infront of customers eyes for awareness
- Ensure AFA materials are easily accessible to **all** members, regardless of technological proficiency. _examples incldude: conference videos, educational documentation, and other digital content_

## Focus Areas

Below are the `focus areas` that various proposials and ititatives will align under. A lot of the `focus areas` listed below are closely related and help implement each other. At this time, this document is still very fluid and may have parts lacking information...

### Boost Membership

Obviously, boosting membership is the name of the game. Without an ever growing member population, the AFA cannot be successful. Below are some suggestions for boosting membership...

_TODO: Enter more proposals_

### Google for Non-Profits

This is a biggie and probably one of the more "game changing" things we can tackle relatively easily. Utilizing [Google for non-pofits](https://www.google.com/nonprofits/?gclid=CjwKCAjww-CGBhALEiwAQzWxOi7teEeJTTeKhVBS7G3zVnGNbsz3ZvGa7QiFHsiOUM5wcTsRZyIY4hoC0NgQAvD_BwE) will help set the AFA up for success in many different way. Some noteable benefits of this are...

 - Google workspace for non-profits => This would give the AFA enhanced acess to products like Gmail, Docs, Calendar, Drive, and Google Meet (for video conferencing).
 - Google Ad Grants => This would allow us to easier attact donors, raise awareness for our mission, and recruite potential volunteers.
 - YouTube Nonprofit Program => This would help ensure that our digital content gets spread all over the world and would enable functionality on our channel to allow users to donate to the AFA directly from our youtube channel/videos.
 - Google Earth => This would help our Non-profit organization show widespread impact for various things local to the US, or globally, on a more interactive platform. This could also be used to help people locate local resources or partners.

### Advertising and Marketing

Advertising and marketing encourages long-term membership and increases the relationships that we can draw on for fundraising initiatives, recurring initiatives, and donations. Below are proposials for `advertising` and `marketing`

- Google Ad Grants (as mentioned above) => provides access to $10,000 USD of in-kind advertising every month for text ads. 
- Schedule regular social media posts => this would allow us to keep content flowing and the AFA consistently in peoples feed. Content can be comprised of various material, such as: member submissions, segments of previous speakers in past conferences, educational videos, and partner videos - like videos in collaboration with [JC Aviary](https://jcaviary.com/)
- Validate and improve search engine `crawl` functionality against AFA website => it is important to ensure reliability and maintainability of existing resources/functionality, such as how search engines return results containing the [AFA Website](https://www.afabirds.org/).

### Social Media Presence

Social media is how most people receive news about events, updates on people/places/things/orgs they care about, and find general connectivity to the digital landscape we find ourselves in, in 2021. Below are some suggestions on how we can boost social media presence.

- Schedule recurring social media posts on all the platforms that allow it => would allow us to effortlessly keep the content we see as most important infront of the eyes of current/potential members.
- Find weekly themes that would engage members to interact with our posts => quick and silly examples: 
  - `birdy peets tuesdays` posts that would engage people on platforms send in pics of their bird's feet
  - `macaw mondays` where people send in pics macaws
  - `bird food cook books` - encourage members to submit content to us that we can then re-release. This could include things like `birdy food cooking how-tos` or `bird toy creation`
  - `member artwork submissions` - there are a lot of talented members out there that produce a lot of amazing bird themed artwork
  - `social media artifacts` - AFA can produce digital artifacts that can be added to member's profiles. Some quick examples of this would be the following:
    - banner of the month that showcases member artwork
    - profile picture overlays
    - instagram headers
- Partner with other organziations, such as [JC Aviary](https://jcaviary.com/), to share content and/or produce joint content
- Create a youtube channel (which will come as a part of [Google for Non-Profits](#google-for-non-profits))
  

### Add new tech/digital/social revenue streams
_TODO: Groom_

### Add more visibility to AFA products
_TODO: Groom_


### AFA Digital Content Accessibility
_TODO: Groom_

### Improve workflow and digital work tracking
_TODO: Groom_


#### Notes and stuff I still need to groom:

- there are 15 years worth of afa conferences recorded onto dvds
- there are avian biology classroom power point presentations worth of avian content aimed at kids
  - this could be turned into content for children 
- afa watchbird - magazine - there are 50 years worth of digital content in the texas digital library
  - we need to find a way to host this in a more reasonable and accessible manner 
- need to create youtube channel
- website will need to be archived at somepoint


Current stuff at conference:
- original art by member artists get featured all the time
- green screens have been used a lot in past conferences to show people with extinct birds
- facebook banners are a thing as well
- photoshop seems to be a common source for material
