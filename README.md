# afa

Most important detail in all of this, visibility comes members first.
Tie into products is really important. There are awesome products out there members arent aware of, like afa bird-bands and bird merch, members are unaware of. 
Notes:

- there are 15 years worth of afa conferences recorded onto dvds
- there are avian biology classroom power point presentations worth of avian content aimed at kids
  - this could be turned into content for children 
- afa watchbird - magazine - there are 50 years worth of digital content in the texas digital library
  - we need to find a way to host this in a more reasonable and accessible manner 
- must come from members 



Needs:
- need to figure out how to track work
- need to create youtube channel
- website will need to be archived at somepoint
- social media needs to become 
- need things people can plug into their social media and forget about
- cute gimmics like "banner of the month" that could feature member artists' artwork
-  

Current stuff at conference:
- original art by member artists get featured all the time
- green screens have been used a lot in past conferences to show people with extinct birds
- facebook banners are a thing as well
- photoshop seems to be a common source for material
