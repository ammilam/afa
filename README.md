* [Boost membership](#boost-membership)
* [Google for Non-Profits](#google-for-non-profits)
* [Advertising and Marketing](#advertising-and-marketing)
* [Social Presence](#social-presence)

* [Produce regular material on social platforms](#produce-regular-metrial-on-social-platforms)
* [AFA Digital Content Accessibility](#afa-digital-content-accessibility)
* [Improve workflow and digital work tracking](#improve-workflow-and-digital-work-tracking)

## Rules To Live By

- Members **must** come first. Any and all endeavors we embark upon must have members placed at the top of the priorty list
- Whenever possible/appropriate, get AFA products infront of customers eyes for awareness
- Ensure AFA materials are easily accessible to **all** members, regardless of technological proficiency. _examples incldude: conference videos, educational documentation, and other digital content_

### Boost Membership

Obviously, boosting membership is the name of the game. Without an ever growing member population, the AFA cannot be successful. Below are some suggestions for boosting membership...

_TODO: Enter more proposals_

### Google for Non-Profits

One of the most importatnt things that we can do is to utilize [Google for non-pofits](https://www.google.com/nonprofits/?gclid=CjwKCAjww-CGBhALEiwAQzWxOi7teEeJTTeKhVBS7G3zVnGNbsz3ZvGa7QiFHsiOUM5wcTsRZyIY4hoC0NgQAvD_BwE). Some noteable benefits of this are...

 - Google workspace for non-profits => This would give the AFA enhanced acess to products like Gmail, Docs, Calendar, Drive, and Google Meet (for video conferencing).
 - Google Ad Grants => This would allow us to easier attact donors, raise awareness for our mission, and recruite potential volunteers.
 - YouTube Nonprofit Program => This would help ensure that our digital content gets spread all over the world and would enable functionality on our channel to allow users to donate to the AFA directly from our youtube channel/videos.
 - Google Earth => This would help our Non-profit organization show widespread impact for various things local to the US, or globally, on a more interactive platform. This could also be used to help people locate local resources or partners.

### Advertising & Marketing

Advertising and marketing encourages long-term membership and increases the relationships that we can draw on for fundraising initiatives, recurring initiatives, and donations. If done correctly, we can turn anything we do into a form of advertising



Notes:

- there are 15 years worth of afa conferences recorded onto dvds
- there are avian biology classroom power point presentations worth of avian content aimed at kids
  - this could be turned into content for children 
- afa watchbird - magazine - there are 50 years worth of digital content in the texas digital library
  - we need to find a way to host this in a more reasonable and accessible manner 
- must come from members 



Needs:
- need to figure out how to track work
- need to create youtube channel
- website will need to be archived at somepoint
- need things people can plug into their social media and forget about
- cute gimmics like "banner of the month" that could feature member artists' artwork
- instagram headers or other stuff
- needs google adwords for non-profit - look into this asap!
- tiktock/instagram, cross share with jc aviary 
- ticktock
- 

Current stuff at conference:
- original art by member artists get featured all the time
- green screens have been used a lot in past conferences to show people with extinct birds
- facebook banners are a thing as well
- photoshop seems to be a common source for material
